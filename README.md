# Whatsapp-Bridge-Connection
# WhatsApp Bridge Bot

A simple WhatsApp bot application that demonstrates basic functionality using the whatsapp_bridge library.

## Features

- Logs incoming WhatsApp messages
- Echoes received text messages back to the sender
- Basic error handling and logging

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- whatsapp_bridge library
- Logging module (built-in)

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install whatsapp_bridge
   ```

2. Ensure you have a valid WhatsApp account and the necessary credentials configured.

## Usage

Run the bot using:
```bash
python "Crack Wh.py"
```

The bot will:
1. Start logging incoming messages
2. Echo back any text messages it receives
3. Log any non-text messages or errors

## Project Structure

- `Crack Wh.py`: Main bot application file containing the WhatsApp bot implementation

## Logging

The bot uses Python's built-in logging module to log:
- Incoming updates
- Echoed messages
- Any errors or warnings

Logs are formatted with timestamps, log level, and detailed messages.

## Note

This is a basic implementation that demonstrates core WhatsApp bot functionality. For production use, consider adding:
- More sophisticated message handling
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Message persistence
- Rate limiting
- Security measures
